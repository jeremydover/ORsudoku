10/6/22ter
	Added additional test cases

10/6/22bis
	Refactored for issue #28, so now regions are stored as (i,j) (0-base) pairs, instead of as the cellValues variables. Updated all functions that required region-based calculations (Rossini, Outside, Region Sum Lines). Specifically greatly improved implementation of Schrödinger cell region sum lines, which required building a variable index for each line. That was a poor design choice.
	
10/6/22
	Added support for scary cells
	Added support for Order Sums Cages
	Added support for parity quads (like entropic quads but for parity) and Quadro (like global entropy, but for parities)
	Added test case
	
10/2/22
	Most of the constraint additions here were inspired by Richard Stolk's Sudoku Variants Series on LMD. Thanks!
	Added support for not-RenbanLines, which supports an upgrade to the global non-consecutive functionality, allowing non-consecutive to be applied to longer strings of contiguous digits.
	Added support for anti-queen digits and cells, including partial anti-queen cells with no repeats on a single diagonal
	Updated Schrödinger cell functions and documentation.

	Added support for No-Three-In-A-Row global constraint
	Added support for maximum triplet clues, and generalized to maximum runs of arbitrary length
	Added support for Search Nine clues.
	Modified setRossini method to not require row/column designation, which is clear from the arrow direction only.

	Added support for Odd-Even Thermos (thermos where all digits are the same parity), and Slow Odd-Even Themors (same thing, but non-decreasing instead of increasing).
	Added Schrödinger test case.
	Thanks to Richard Stolk for the inspiration for most of the new constraints implemented in this push.

9/29/22

9/26/22
	Added superposition Schrödinger cell class and some constraints.
	Added support for reverse X-sums (originated by kuraban, thanks to Qodec's recent puzzle for the inspiration!)

	Added test case
	
9/20/22bis

	Added some debug code to try to troubleshoot weird Broken 159 error in finding all solutions. (Repeatedly reports same solution.)
	Generalized doubler code to accomodate variants, including arbitrary affine transformations (ax+b) and double-or-nothing rules. New framework allows additional generalizations.
	Added new test cases

9/17/22bis
