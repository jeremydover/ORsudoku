1/20/2026
	Expanded support for TopDown conditions to LeftRight, and Global. Added test case.

1/18/2026 bis
	Abstracted modelling Kropki relationships so that it is between two variables, not necessarily two adjacent cell values.
	Implemented support for Kroopki dots, and included test case.
	Did a TopDownCondition global constraint, which allows the user to model "top heavy" type constraints, where two vertically adjacent cells that meet one condition must meet a second. Implemented test case.
	Added 'Difference' selection criterion for hanging sums.

1/18/2026
	Moved some helper functions out of __init__ that really belonged in utilities. Look at me cleaning stuff up.
	Adding a global "digit tracking" property. Normally, the code tracks the digit in a cell as an array of ints, and this
	is good for a lot of things. But when we need to count digits in a region, we need a more robust structure, which is essentially an array of Bools that says: is cell X this digit? is cell X that digit? is cell X the other digit? This massively inflates the model, so we don't want to do it unnecessarily. Moreover, even if we have to do it for some cells, we don't want to have to do it for all. So by setting up this property, we can do a lazy creation for an object variable to track this, and only create the Bools (and associated Ints) for the variables that need it, and by keeping them around we can reuse them, and not recreate them with every constraint.
	Updated and greatly simplified shaken clone code with new digit tracking.
	Added support for digit comparison zones, which allow the comparison of the number of digits between zones, with match counted by either presence or multiplicity. Added test cases.

1/16/2026
	Moved getRegion function from main constructor to _utilities
	Added support for disparity constraint, added test case; extended support to "disentropy" and "dismodular"
	Added support for N-Mates, added test case (h/t EPH, via BremSter)
	Added alias for Exclusion Quads, implemented using existing Block Cages primitive, added test case (h/t Bill Murphy)
	Updated sweeper cell code to allow an offset, so that the number of cells matching the condition can be the sweeper cell value + the offset. As part of update, identified bug in sweeper cell negative constraint which was using default options instead of those previously entered. Added test case.
	Added augment option to zipper lines which allows sum to increase/decrease by a fixed amount as the sums get further from the middle. Added test case (h/t Richard Stolk).

11/26/2025
	Added support for S-cell counting circles. Improved existing counting circles code to handle non-positive digits better.

6/22/2025
	Added support for Russian Doll clues (h/t oddlyeven)

3/24/2025 bis
	Added selection criterion for conditional sum and count clues to select digits in an increasing/decreasing pair along the line.
	Added clock quad constraints, which assert that the digits around a quad increase either clockwise or counterclockwise from some starting point. Negative constraint implemented, and test case provided.

3/24/2025
	Added support for sweeper cells to match all neighbors, not just the value of the sweeper cell.
	Added new selection criterion for conditional sums and counts to *not* match the parity, entropy, etc. of a taret cell.
	Added support for order sum cages (a list of cages ordered by increasing sum) to calculate the sum as if reading the cage as a base 10 number. Also fixed a bug which caused the previous code to fail.
	Added test cases.

3/20/2025
	Added support for ContiguousSum selection criterion for conditional sums and count. Included test case.
	Implemented new property "DigitSize", which can be used for "big/small" type constraints, particularly in conditional sums and counts. Included test case.
	
3/10/2025 ter
	Added some more test cases.

3/10/2025 bis
	Added RelatedDigit selection criterion for conditional sums and counts.
	Added support for sweeper cells using conditional sum selection criteria, allowing for many different types. Included negative constraint, and added test case.
	Added crust sum, crust digit instance, and star battle configuration options for crust cell sudoku. Reset the "enforceRegions" default for crust cells to False, and updated test cases accordingly. Added test case.
	Added support for indexed pair sums, and added test case.
	Added support for Majority Property/Minority Property selection criteria, where the property with the largest or smallest incidence is selected for summing or counting.
	Added support for Row/Column Region Sums, asserting the sum of the cells in the intersection of the row/column with some region.

3/10/2025
	Fixed bug in PropertyNeighbors changes from 3/9/2025 push. That's what I get for only spot testing instead of running the full test suite.
	Adding support to rayCount and raySum to let them work on constraints which could go other either direction, but only one. Included test case.

3/9/2025
	Augmented the PropertyNeighbors (e.g. ParityNeighbors) functionality to allow comparisons to the property of a cell at a fixed position in the list, or to a cell indexed by a cell at a fixed position in the list. Added test case.

3/7/2025
	Extended X-Distance concept to crust sandwich sudoku, where the digit next to the clue gives the distance between the crusts.
	Included test case.

3/6/2025
	Added support for multi-digit missing arrows, aka hidden arrows. Includes test case.
	Added support for broken X-Sums, where the length of the sum is one less than, or one greater than, the indexing cell. Includes test case.
	Added support for Potpourri N-Sums, and added test cases.
	Added support for min values and min parity values on quads.
	Added option for min/max quad values to specify value must be unique on the quad.
	Added support for max/min parity on a quad, asserting the parity of the max/min digit on the quad. Includes test case.
	Added support for X-Distance clues, including test case.
	I should mention, most of my recent work has been mining the Sudoku Variants Series of Richard Stolk. I
	throw a couple of my own ideas in there, particularly for generalizations, but most of the base logic
	owes an enormous debt of gratitude. Thanks Richard!
	
3/5/2025
	All background changes. Add Boolean enforcement conditions for conditional enforcement lines. This is either the wave of the future, or a prompt to re-factor. Whatevs. Nutshell: fixed the variable flapping problem with test-raySum.
	
3/4/2025
	Added support for conditional rays sums and counts, where an initiator cell is chosen along a line, or in a row/column, which may be anywhere. The solver may count/sum selected cells along one or both of the forward/backward rays from the initiator. Line versions are setConditionalCountSegment and setConditionalSumSegment; row/column versions are setRayCount, setRaySum.
	Added test cases.
	Note: there is a subtle bug in the new code which is preventing countSolutions from working. There is some variable
	flapping somewhere which is creating multiple solutions. Pushing for now since code can still be used to identify possibilities, but will need to come back and fix.

3/3/2025 bis
	Added Skyscrapers selection criterion for hanging sums and counts, and conditional lines. No need to use this versus setSkyscraper when appropriate, but this does allow more flexibility. (Hopefully for what I'm going for next.)

3/3/2025
	Made minor update to utility function to better allow model variables to be passed as values to conditional sum and count lines.
	Added forceTermination flag to hanging clues and conditional lines, allowing the possibility that a value may still be returned if no terminator is found.
	Added support for conditional cross counts, which perform counts across all orthogonal rays emanating from a cell...used to support
	watchtower constraint.
	Added test case.

2/28/2025 ter
	Added terminator for conditional and hanging clues that allows user to pass a model variable to indicate the position at which to terminate.
	Added test cases.
	This is the first time I've used model variables in my solver building, and it is super powerful, but probably unfair 
	to the average user.

2/28/2025 bis
	Added support for comparators (LE, GE, NE) in hanging count and sum clues, and conditional sum lines and conditional count lines.
	Added new selection criteria of property runs, e.g. parity run, entropy run, etc., which allow comparisons against groups 
	of contiguous digits satisfying the associated property. Think "second group of odd digits sums to 18" or "last group of low digits has two digits".
	Added new selection criteria of ascending/descending runs, as above.
	Added test cases.

2/28/2025
	Added support for star battle/sudoku hybrid puzzles.

2/26/2025 bis
	Added support for ranked cages, with test cases.
	Added additional test cases.

2/26/2025
	Added support for repeated neighbors constraint, and added test case.
	Added support for slot machine, and added test case.
	Added additional test cases.

2/24/2025 bis
	Added test cases.

2/24/2025
	Eliminated terminateOnFirst argument from conditional lines and hanging clues in favor of a terminateOn argument, which defaults to the value 'First'.
	Any existing code for which terminateOnFirst was not set will continue to work. Any code that explicitly set terminateOnFirst=True can be patched by
	replacing with the string terminateOn='First', while code that implemented terminateOnFirst=False can be updated by replacing this string with
	terminateOn='Any'. Sorry for breaking backward compatibility, but hoping the feature is new enough it is not widely used. Updated test cases appropriately.
	
	Added new termination criteria ParityRepeatReached, for all of parity, entropy, modular, primality.
	Fixed bug in neighbor matching which was incorrectly excluding endpoints in the 'All' neighbors selection.
	Added test cases.

2/19/2025
	Added test case for next to nine sum.
	Added support for selection criteria for neighbors matching on entropy, parity, modular or primality, similar to criteria for having consecutive neighbors.
	Added support for Related Digit termination, where the termination criterion for a sum can be based upon an affine (ax+b) relationship with the value in a given cell.
	Added test cases for new selection and termination functionality.

2/12/2025
	Fixed some small bugs
	Added support for pool constraint, which is pretty dumb
	
2/6/2025 bis
	Added support for conditional instance lines and hanging instance clues (like conditional sum, but testing presence of digits matching the criteria instead of the sum of the criteria)
	Added selection criteria related to digits having consecutive neighbors.
	Note: these have undergone some initial testing, but need more. Am pushing solely to get code code back home.

2/6/2025
	Added test cases. Fixed minor bug in Repeating Arrows introduced with re-factor.
	Implemented NoRepeats selection criterion for hanging sums.

2/5/2025
	Reviewed use of self.minDigit and self.maxDigit in code, as relates to doublers and other transforms. Made several changes to ensure variable bounds are sized appropriately for expanded cell values.

	Added some test cases.

2/4/2025 ter

	Provided return codes for all solving methods.
	Added support for conditional count lines.
	Modified conditional selections to include BeforeDigits, AfterDigits, and NextToDigits.
	Partial implementation of DigitInstance conditional selection..just pushing to pass code home.

2/4/2025
	Added support for InOrder clues.

2/2/2025
	Added assertion to ensure solutions are not roped. Not so much a constraint, as much as for grid searching.
	Greatly improved performance for 10 Lines, added test case, and added support for closed loop 10 lines.

1/29/2025
	Added support for Broken Thermos.
	Added additional test cases.

1/28/2025
	Added support for Double Thermos, which interleave an even and an odd thermo, which act independently. Added test cases.
	Added support for Removed Bulb Thermos, where a bulb may be placed anywhere on the thermo, resulting in one or two thermos.
	
1/27/2025 ter-ducken?
	Extended hangingSum 'Location' option to allow multiple specifications, including a new indexing option. Multiple specifications are joined with logical OR. Added test case.

1/27/2025 ter
	Added support for conditional sandwich sums. Sandwich is defined by a pair of digits as normal, but the digits to be summed can be selected using any method from hanging sums. Available as an option for crust sandwich sudoku as well, where sandwich clues defined by crusts are filtered with the selection criteria. Added test case.
	Re-wrote max ascending clues to be more efficient (using the ORTools internal MaxEquality instead of rolling my own), and also more flexible. Now one can test the "length" of a run on either the number of digits, or the sum of the digits: e.g., 19 would be considered "longer" than 234 because it has a higher sum. Moreover, one can compare the value against either length or sum, independent of which is tested. Added test case.	

1/27/2025 bis
	Added support for hidden clones, and test case.

1/27/2025
	Added support for MaxMin Sum Cages, which provide the sum of the largest and smallest digits in the cage.

1/25/2025 bis
	Added support for Dutch flat mates, and a test case.

1/25/2025
	Reconfigured select and terminate criteria to unify code behind Parity, Modular, Entropy and Primality. Makes addition of
	any other digit classifications pretty straightforward.
	Implemented new selection criteria: 'ParityMatch' (and EntropyMatch...), and Unique Digits.
	Implemented support for lot lines (Issue #60) 
	
1/24/2025
	Added depth support to skyscrapers clues, so that clues only "see" a fixed number of cells into the puzzle
	Added test cases.
	Moved row/col condition selector to a utility function, simplifying HangingSum implementation, and allowing code to be repurposed for XCount.
	Added an 'Indexed' termination constraint to the hanging code, so that termination can be picked via indexing, a la XSums. While XSums can now be implemented as Hanging Sums, the implementation is quite a bit slower.
	Implemented XCount and XAverage clues via analogous HangingCount and HangingAverage. Added test cases.
	Added 'DigitSet', 'BeforeDigit' and 'AfterDigit' selection criteria for hanging clues.

1/23/2025bis
	Added some test cases.
	Added support for neighbor sets, which assert a cell has a neighbor matching on some property.
	Added additional features to X-Sums, which allows the cell which picks the length of the sum to be in the first given number of cells, or in the first region.

1/23/2025
	Pushed earlier in the day was a "behind-the-scenes" update that cleaned up some base object variables that needed to be duplicated across the code base. Nothing fancy, all tests still passed, some technical debt paid down.
	This latest push contains the implementation of hanging sums. Basically, these give you pretty granular detail on how to pick cells to create
	a sum, and how far into the grid the sum should extend. Very powerful. Maybe too powerful. You can implement "the sum of the even digits starting from the third cell and continuing until the fourth odd digit in the row is 8". But you really shouldn't unless you want solvers to hate you. Parity party can be implemented with this function (though there's an existing native setParityParty), but there are some other test cases for which this works too.

1/22/2025
	Fixed error in Roman sums shorthand processing with multi-digit sum values.
	Fixed error in Schrödinger sum application of XV negative constraint.
	Fixed error in shift line code.
	Added Schrödinger support for whispers lines.
	Implemented support for ambiguous cages, where the cage sum may be one of several values.

	For transform and S-cells, added anti-knight rules to ensure modifier cells are not a knight's move apart.
	For transform sudoku, added rule to ensure that for each modifier cell, no cell a king's (or a knight's) move from the modifier has the same base digit.
	Implemented short sandwich clues, and added test case. Updated sandwich sums to allow clues on bottom/right of grid.
	Updated to test harness to allow pytest as well as nose2.
	Added support for NextToNine sum clues.
	Added support for XAverages, including test case.
	Added support for offset digits, including test case.
	Added support for "domino-based" negative constraints for Kropki and Roman sums; negative constraint is only applied between two adjacent cells that are not already in a positive clue.
	Added support for remote Kropki arrows...negative constraint is not supported.
	Added additional test cases.

1/21/2025
	Fixed error in setParityCountLine, and added test case.
	Fixed some bugs in Schrödinger cell module left over from migration to v1.0.
	Simplified Schrödinger Renban and Between line code, added test cases.
	Fixed error in Schrödinger XV negative constraint code, added test cases.
	Fixed error in WeakPalindromeLine implementation, and added test case.
	Added additional test cases.
	And, oh why did I start this? Changing to a new model of negative constraint tracking that does not require separate class variables for each type (God that was dumb).
	Oh, this is why I started this: created ability to separate Kropki black/white and XV X/V from a negative constraint perspective, so that we can support only a negative X constraint, or a negative black Kropki constraint.
	And because I'm a glutton for punishment, also re-did the XV code to generalize to "Roman sums", to allow any values to be used, and have a negative constraint applied.

1/19/2025 bis
	Fixed syntax error in _solving module for listCandidates solving method.
	Updated setNearestNeighbors method to accept a single direction as an int, instead of a list with a single int.

9/4/2024
	Added support for Unique Pairs Lines, a set of lines where each line has no repeats, and the set of digits on any pair of lines have a most one common digit. Constraint due to Paletron...thanks!
	Added support for cell index lines, a set of lines which index a set of cells, in different rows, columns, and having different digits, such that read one direction or the other, the line indexes a row/column/value triple. Constraint due to KenGlue...thanks!
	Updated zone constraint to allow inclusion of nulls, i.e. digits which cannot appear in the zone.

	Did some cleanup in Battlefield constraint code, though this did not resolve issue #57.
	Added support for global neighbor sums, issue #44; added test case.
	Moved most test cases from findSolution to countSolutions, since this gives a stronger test, ensuring that the solver verifies that solutions are unique. This did identify one constraint issue, likely with battlefield constraints.
	Updated solution printer class to accommodate test printing for countSolutions when using cellTransform or Japanese Sums sudoku.
	Updated Quattroquadri code to remove some legacy references to doubler code from which it was copied. Added QuattroQuadri test case.

	Refactored for issue #28, so now regions are stored as (i,j) (0-base) pairs, instead of as the cellValues variables. Updated all functions that required region-based calculations (Rossini, Outside, Region Sum Lines).
